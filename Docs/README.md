\# iRun Platform — Runner Operating System

\#\# Vision  
iRun is a single platform serving runners, readers, customers, and the iRun team.

It combines:  
\- Media (Magazine & Editorial)  
\- Commerce (iRun Shop)  
\- Community (Events, Clubs, Challenges)  
\- Training Utilities (Plans, Routes, Tools)  
\- Internal Operations (Editorial, Support, Commerce Ops)

The platform has two faces:  
1\. Public-facing Runner Experience  
2\. Internal Company Dashboard (iRun OS)

\#\# Core Goals  
\- Become a daily-use platform for runners  
\- Increase reader → member → customer conversion  
\- Reduce internal operational friction  
\- Enable modular growth without rewrites

\#\# Product Philosophy  
\- Runner-first utility \> vanity features  
\- Simple, calm UX over gamification noise  
\- Canadian-first terminology and pricing  
\- Human \+ assistive AI (no black-box decisions)
